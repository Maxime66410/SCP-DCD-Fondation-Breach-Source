"SCP: DCD Fondation Breach" It's a game based on "SCP: Containment Breach" and "SCP: Secret Laboratory".

A containment breach by SCP 173 has happened during an experiment, all personnel at 5 meter from the perimeter got killed by SCP 173, except 1 scientist that managed to escape. During his escape, the scientist wanted to activate the security alarm, but in his panic, he pushed the button that opens all SCP containment chambers as well as the D class personnel. The scientist in question got killed by not looking at SCP 173 in his panic.


So of course, everyone will spawn in the building at the beginning of each game and you will have 1 minute and a half to move away from the containment chambers. The class D personnel will be freed at the same time as the SCP, and the Chaos Resurrection as well as a small Nine Tail Fox group will spawn outside the building.

The game rules are very simple so to speak.l
The SCP must kill everyone, the class D must try to escape the building. However, the class D will be confronted to the Nine Tailed Fox and the scientist as well as the SCP. The objective of the Nine Tailed Fox and the guard dog is to save the scientist and to kill the other teams. However the Nine tailed Fox are also confronted to the SCP and the Chaos Resurrection, they, on the other hand, have to save the class D and kill the other individuals, so be careful not to see them ;3

And let’s not forget the scientists who can be allied with the class D and the other teams, have to escape the building as well !
